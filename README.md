#Hangman

####Intro
For this game, the user will be able to choose from a series of topics such as movies, music, food, etc. These topics will serve as clues for the phrases that the player is meant to guess. The player must choose one letter a time only--even if he/she already knows what the whole phrase is. If the player does not guess the phrase before the man's body is completely hung, the player loses and will be prompted with a message that will allow him/her to try again and pick from one of the categories.

####Technologies used:
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Javascript
+ jQuery

####Approach
I will set up my phrase categories and the design of the page in HTML and use CSS for styling. I will use images for the body of the hangman. For the game logic, such as determining the winner, detecting a loss, I will use Javascript. jQuery will be used for user interaction, such as when a user inputs a guessing letter, when the letter is correct and appears above its dash, and when a user guesses incorrectly and a part of the man's body appears on the screen.

####Stretch Goals
If I manage to accomplish all of my goals, I will attempt the following:

+ Have the player guess the whole phrase, and not just one letter at a time. If the user guesses the whole phrase incorrectly, then the user will automatically lose and the entire man will be hung!
+ Allow the user to determine level off difficulty (easier levels have more body parts, therefore more guesses)
